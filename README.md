# BunBundle
BunBundle is a work in progress Monogame sprite organization tool and packer. It presents an easy to navigate tree structure for your sprite resource.
You can easily replace sprites, set their origins and organize them inside BunBundle.

Because working with strings are the worst, upon building a C# class is generated that contains all your sprites in a tree format.

## Download
Since the tool is currently in progress and quite unstable, there are no public releases.

## Building from source
The tool is available as both a console line application (only for building) and as a graphical interface. Both projects require .NET5.0 and can be built from inside Visual Studio.

## Upcoming features
* Texture page packing
* Rewrite view in Desktop Blazor
* Disable mipmapping
